# Citing bvar-toolkit

The code here implements methods from the papers below. If you use it in your work, please
cite the paper behind each method you use. The table maps each replication package, library
function and example to that paper, and the BibTeX for every entry follows. A study usually
needs more than one row: one for the model it estimates and one for each sampler inside it.
To credit the software as well, cite the toolkit record at the end. [`RELATED.md`](RELATED.md)
lists implementations of the same models in R and Python.

A stochastic volatility in mean model whose coefficients evolve over time, estimated by an
accept-reject Metropolis-Hastings step that draws the whole log-volatility path in one block from
a Gaussian proposal at the mode of its conditional density. That step is what `bvar.sv.csv_armh`
adapts to the common volatility factor.

A multivariate stochastic volatility specification that avoids the lower triangular
parameterization of the error covariance matrix, is identified through the stochastic
volatility and is invariant to the ordering of the variables, with an MCMC algorithm for
estimation and prediction.

[Working paper](https://joshuachan.org/papers/BVAR-MF-R1.pdf)

An efficient approach to sampling the missing values of a conditionally Gaussian state space
model in one block, from a conditional distribution whose precision matrix is banded for common
missing data patterns, with restrictions that tie missing high-frequency values to observed
low-frequency ones. Its applications are a weekly mixed-frequency VAR with common stochastic
volatility, which produces weekly GDP estimates, and a dynamic factor model with stochastic
volatility on unbalanced FRED-MD vintages.
